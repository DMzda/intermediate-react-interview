# Intermediate React Coding Interview Solution

This is a solution written for the mock interview conducted by Ben Awad on his Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s0OVdoo4Q4).

It consists of a react app which:

- Fetches data from an API
- Manipulates the data by flattening the location object
- Displays the results in a table
- Allows it to be sorted in ascending, descending and the default order by clicking the table column headers
- Allows the rows to be filtered by typing in the text box
